This page describes the Build Champion role. This is a weekly rotating role within the team.

## Responsibilities

- Daily: [Triage all failed and partially succeeded builds](#triage-non-green-builds)
- Daily: [Ensure a green Insiders build from `main`](#green-insiders-build)
- At least once during the week: [Review and triage error telemetry](#triage-error-telemetry)
- On the following Monday: Hand over the role to the next person
- Build champ buddy: The build champ buddy is a role that you take the week following being the build champ. The buddy is responsible for investigating important build failures when the build champ on the other site is offline.

## Triage non-green builds

ðŸ‘‰ The main role of the build champ is to ensure our build remains trusted by driving down flakiness and to reduce team randomization.

We have an internal `#build` channel that a bot posts to with the results of all builds of the `main` branch on ADO. It's important to review all these failures and create issues because ignoring non-green builds ends up causing the build quality to get worse and worse over time, resulting in a loss of trust of tests, multiple retries, waste of engineering resources, etc.

It's expected that the build champion reviews all `failed` and `partiallySucceeded` builds and actions them appropriately at least once per day. The main focus is to triage and route the failure to the right owner and/or create an issue, so that the build continues to be healthy and run smoothly. **It is _not_ your job to fix the problem unless you own the feature area. It is expected that the build champion to investigate and fix build pipeline related issues like Terrapin for example** 

Follow this as a rough guide for how to review a build:

1. Open the "Build" link which will go to GH Actions or ADO
2. Click into the failed step and review the failure
3. If an issue is already created for this failure, mark the thread with a âœ… to indicate it's actioned
4. If not action the failure and then mark the thread with âœ…, here are some common failure types and how to handle them:

**Test failure:**
If it looks like the test failed because of the linked change, ping the [area owner](#area-owners).
If it looks like the test flaked, search [GH issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) for the failure (useful queries: [smoke-test-failure](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asmoke-test-failure), [integration-test-failure](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aintegration-test-failure), [unit-test-failure](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aunit-test-failure)) and comment on it if found, otherwise create an issue for the [area owner](#area-owners). If you end up seeing the test flake multiple times, you can skip the test and comment on the associated issue.


**Compile failure:**
If this was a recent failure and the "Changes" seems relevant, ping the committer if they have not yet commented.

**Terrapin failures:**
- It could be caching issue for that specific pipeline instance so try to rerun the failed task and if it does not work, try to run a completely new build.
- If the failure still occurs, contact the Terrapin team (terrapin@microsoft.com) and let them know that we run `npx https://aka.ms/enablesecurefeed standAlone` as well as detailed info on the errors we're getting. Also reach out to them by creating an IcM ticket against them: https://aka.ms/icm. They have a team there **Terrapin**.


ðŸ‘‰ It's important to use âœ… on failed builds as that helps save other team members from investigating failures that don't need it which could happen when they're pinged directly.


## Green Insiders Build

It is crucial for our success to have a green insiders build from `main` branch that gets published to our [update site](https://builds.code.visualstudio.com/builds/insider) at least once on a day. Various tools depend on this to happen, for example performance testing to figure out performance regressions early. 

Insider builds are scheduled to running daily automatically. In case of failure, it is your responsibility to act accordingly:
* when automated release is disabled (debt week): run the [pipeline](https://monacotools.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Monaco/_build?definitionId=111) but do not release the build
* when automated release is enabled (otherwise): run the [pipeline](https://monacotools.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Monaco/_build?definitionId=111) and release the build

ðŸ‘‰ even in debt week, when the automated release is disabled, we still want the daily insiders build to succeed (but not released!). this ensures our daily rhythm is not impacted at all and we can act on build issues early on


## Triage error telemetry

Our error telemetry captures any uncaught errors thrown in VS Code and presents them in https://errors.code.visualstudio.com/. This website allows us to view errors by each release and they also contain stats on the number of hits and machines that particular error had. Errors typically represent a case that wasn't considered in code, a broken feature and/or a bad error notification presented to the user.

At least one time during the week of being the Build Champion you should triage the errors in **the most recent ~3 pages** for a recent insiders build as well as the stable build.

Here are some examples of the types of errors you will encounter and how to handle them:


**e is not iterable**

Deminified Stack

```
TypeError: e is not iterable
at s in extensions/github/src/util.ts:12:28
at /extensions/github/dist/extension.js:2:97385
at u.fire in src/vs/base/common/event.ts:577:16
at i.deltaExtensions in src/vs/workbench/services/extensions/common/extensionDescriptionRegistry.ts:88:21
at v.$deltaExtensions in src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostExtensionService.ts:792:18
at processTicksAndRejections in internal/process/task_queues.js:93:5
```

This error looks actionable, you can tell from the paths in the stack trace that the error is within the core github extension, it also looks easily actionable. An issue should be created here (which will mark the error as triaged), and then duplicates that are encountered can also be checked off as triaged.


**XHR failed**

Deminified Stack

```
Error: XHR failed
at XMLHttpRequest.C.onerror in src/vs/base/parts/request/browser/request.ts:26:29
```

This error does not look actionable, while we can find where the error is thrown in code, it's unclear why this error is thrown so we would not be able to handle it properly.




## Appendix

### Area owners

If you're unsure who owns an area, you can roughly determine who an owner is by checking the history (git log) of the file it's contained within. Note that sometimes unrelated people perform refactoring or clean ups so look for the most active person and/or the one that is making changes related to that feature/test.
