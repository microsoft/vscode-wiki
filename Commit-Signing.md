This guide will show you how you can configure your development setup to automatically sign git commits using GPG and link your GPG key with GitHub.

# Prerequisites

Make sure you follow the [Prerequisites, How To Contribute (microsoft/vscode)](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#prerequisites) guide.

# Install Tools

#### Windows 10

Install [Gpg4win](https://gpg4win.org/) and make sure Git uses that GPG version:

```
git config --global gpg.program "C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG\bin\gpg.exe"
```

#### macOS Big Sur

Install the necessary tools and configure GPG:

```bash
brew install gpg2 gnupg pinentry-mac
mkdir -p ~/.gnupg
echo "pinentry-program $(brew --prefix)/bin/pinentry-mac" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
echo "use-agent" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
echo 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)' >> ~/.bash_profile # replace with ~/.zprofile if using ZSH
```

Restart your machine. Yes, really.

# Create Signing Key

There are two options: [generate](#generate-key) or [copy an existing key](#copy-key).

## Generate Key

> **Windows:** make sure you're using a Command Prompt or PowerShell instead of the Git Bash shell. Make sure the right GPG is being used:
>
> ```
> C:\Users\User> where gpg
> C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG\bin\gpg.exe
> ```

Run:

```
gpg --full-generate-key
```

With the following options:

- Kind of key: `RSA and RSA (default)`
- Keysize: `4096`
- Expiration: `0` (does not expire)
- Real Name: use your real name
- Email address: use your Microsoft email address
- Comment: `Key for signing commits for Microsoft`
- **Passphrase**: Pick a long, secure passphrase, which you'll easily remember.

In the following example, `DF536B632D7967F9` is the **key ID**:

```sh
$ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
/home/joao/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
-----------------------------
sec   rsa4096/DF536B632D7967F9 2021-04-07 [SC]
      1D0FC7C0350BB570143C934FDF536B632D7967F9
uid                 [ultimate] Joao Moreno (Key for signing commits for Microsoft) <joao.moreno@microsoft.com>
ssb   rsa4096/41FC60C87D442095 2021-04-07 [E]
```

You can use your key ID to get your **public key**:

```sh
$ gpg --armor --export DF536B632D7967F9
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
...
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

## Copy Key

Alternatively, you can export a existing key from another machine, by replacing `KEYID` with your key ID:

```
gpg --export-secret-keys -a KEYID > my-key.asc
```

Then, copy it into your machine and import it:

```
gpg --import my-key.asc
```

Finally, set its trust level to `ultimate`:

```bash
$ gpg --edit-key KEYID
gpg> trust
Your decision? 5
```

# Configure GitHub

Follow the [Adding a new GPG key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account) guide to give GitHub your **public key**.

# Configure Git

Run the following, replacing `KEYID` with your key ID:

```
git config --global user.signingkey KEYID
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

Git will now sign all commits by default. Signing requires access to your GPG key, which requires the passphrase. Follow the respective platform specific steps below to decrease pain.

#### Windows

Create a dummy commit on a sample local repository. You should see a prompt for your key's passphrase:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22350/113867665-ae7e4780-9763-11eb-9275-4450648f01c2.png)

Enter your GPG key **passphrase** and hit OK. In order to avoid typing the passphrase on every commit, you can make GPG remember it for 8 hours or until the next reboot:

1. Launch Kleopatra
2. Click `Settings > Configure Kleopatra...`
3. Navigate to `GnuPG System > Private Keys`
4. Change `Expire cached PINs after N seconds` to `28800`

#### macOS

Create a dummy commit on a sample local repository. You should see a prompt for your key's passphrase:

In order to avoid typing the passphrase on every commit, just select `Save in Keychain`. That should've been the last time you typed the passphrase.

#### Ubuntu 18.04

Create a dummy commit on a sample local repository. You should see a prompt for your key's passphrase:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22350/113851014-e67b8f80-974f-11eb-95d4-d951ff962ca3.png)

Enter your GPG key **passphrase** and hit OK. In order to avoid typing the passphrase on every commit, you can make GPG remember it for 8 hours or until the next reboot:

```
mkdir -p ~/.gnupg
echo "default-cache-ttl 28800" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
```

> Note: Apparently, it's a moot point to select `Save in password manager`, [because problems](https://wiki.gnupg.org/GnomeKeyring) ðŸ™„. Every time you reboot your machine you'll always be asked for your passphrase. If you select `Save in password manager`, you'll also be asked for your Keyring password every time you reboot, so it's best not to do it.

# Verify Setup

Make sure that if you push a signed commit to GitHub it appears as `Verified`:

# FAQ

### How important is this key?

You should guard this key as well as you guard your SSH key, maybe even better. While an SSH key can easily be replaced by another, since it only affects the login to Github, a GPG key will forever be associated with your commits. This means that as soon as you remove the GPG key from GitHub, because say you replaced it with another, the commits won't appear `Verified` any longer.

### How can I best store this key?

One of the best ways to store a backup or even to use the key directly is to use a [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/). You can store a copy of your key in a YubiKey, serving as a backup. Or you can even store the only copy of your key in it and always require your YubiKey when creating commits. This definitely increases security but with the obvious added cost of always needing your YubiKey around. [Learn more](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013790259-Using-Your-YubiKey-with-OpenPGP).

### What about Codespaces?

Codespaces will use a different GPG key, but it will indeed sign all your commits automatically, so they appear as verified on GitHub. [Learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/managing-gpg-verification-for-codespaces).
