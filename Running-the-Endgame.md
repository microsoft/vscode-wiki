Each iteration closes with an [endgame](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Development-Process#end-game).

## Duties of the endgame champion

> Proactive communication is key to a smooth and successful endgame.

- Update iteration plan issue with the endgame schedule (see template below and potentially last month's schedule)
  - Ensure each plan item is linked to a test item
- Discuss the endgame schedule in Monday's planning call
  - Find an endgame buddy in the other lab
  - Remind people to update their testing availability and platform(s) in the call and release channel
- Ensure each test item has meaningful content
- Assign test items to testers (usually platform specific) using the [testplan tool](https://vscode-tools.azurewebsites.net/); ensure fair distribution across testers
- Communicate test assignments in the `release` Slack channel by posting the test item queries ([example query](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=label%3Atestplan-item+milestone%3A%22June+2016%22+is%3Aclosed))
- Communicate end of day progress in the `release` Slack channel by communicating
   - the number of issues filed
   - the number of test items not yet completed ([example query](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=label%3Atestplan-item+milestone%3A%22June+2016%22+is%3Aclosed))
   - number of issues to be [verified](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Tracking#verification)
- Assign owners to checklist items for each day (if not owned by the endgame master)
- Track progress on test items and checklist items
- Adjust schedule, particularly the publishing dates, based on defects found, fixes made, holidays, vacations, etc.

## Recovery Build

We release one or more recovery builds with a handful of critical fixes and translation updates a few days after a release. The candidate fixes are reviewed by the development team and are assigned to a recovery milestone. We want to be restrictive about the included candidates. The mindset is "we will lose users if we do not include the fix". Here are some examples:
- data loss
- a regression that users complain loudly about in issues or Twitter
- a significant performance regression
- an issue that impacts many users as indicated by telemetry data
- an embarrassing UI glitch
- critical security fixes (see Patch Tuesday Release Endgame Template below)
- an issue that impacts extensions or is an API regression
