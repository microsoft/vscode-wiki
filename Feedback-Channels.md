As a development team we want to be present on many channels (github issues, twitter, stack overflow, user voice, gitter). We want to be responsive and at the same time be effective, for example, we want to avoid having to provide the same answer on different channels. This page describes how the development team intends to use and be active on the different channels.

## [Github issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues)
Issues on github should be used for bugs and feature requests. How to submit good bugs and feature requests is described in [[Submitting Bugs and Suggestions]] and how we track issues is described in [[Issue Tracking]].

Notice, we don't want to use Github Issues for general 'how-to' questions about Code. We will therefore redirect general 'how-to' questions to Stack Overflow. 

## [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode)
Stack Overflow is the best place for getting high quality answers. Many Code community members are already on Stack Overflow and provide great answers to 'how-to' questions. A development team member tracks stack overflow for questions without an answer and jumps in as needed. 

>Therefore please do not be upset when we close an issue with the comment to ask a question on Stack Overflow. 

## [Gitter Chat Room](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/vscode)
The Gitter channel provides a place where the Community can get together and collaborate. It is actually great to see that folks have already started to collaborate and support each other there. However, the VS Code team's presence in the room will be very limited, at least for the foreseeable future. We hope the Community will use the room and have discussions.

## [User Voice](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/293070-visual-studio-code)
User voice is great for voting a for a particular feature, but user voice is limited when it comes to discuss the feature with the development team. Therefore the development team does not engage into a discussion on user voice. Instead once development starts on a feature request a corresponding github issue is created and the discussion takes place there. 

## [Twitter](https://twitter.com/code)
We use the **@code** account on twitter for announcements and members from the development team watch for tweets for @code.
