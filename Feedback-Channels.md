As a development team we want to be present on many channels (GitHub issues, Twitter, Stack Overflow, Gitter). We want to be responsive and at the same time be effective, for example, we want to avoid having to provide the same answer on different channels. This page describes how the development team intends to use and be active on the different channels.

## GitHub issues
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) should be used for bugs and feature requests. How to submit good bugs and feature requests is described in [How to Contribute](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and how we track issues is described in [[Issue Tracking]].

Notice, we don't want to use GitHub Issues for general 'how-to' questions about Code. We will therefore redirect general 'how-to' questions to Stack Overflow. 

## Stack overflow
[Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode) is the best place for getting high quality answers. Many Code community members are already on Stack Overflow and provide great answers to 'how-to' questions. A development team member tracks stack overflow for questions without an answer and jumps in as needed. 

>Therefore please do not be upset when we close an issue with the comment to ask a question on Stack Overflow. 

## Gitter Chat Room
The [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/vscode) provides a place where the Community can get together and collaborate. It is actually great to see that folks have already started to collaborate and support each other there. 

The VS Code team's presence in the room will be optional, at least for the foreseeable future. We hope the Community will use the room and have discussions.

## Slack
The [Visual Studio Code Development Community](https://aka.ms/vscode-dev-community) Slack workspace is a community maintained place for VS Code contributors, extension developers, theme authors, etc to help one another and collaborate. This Slack workspace contains many discussion channels including many for specific extensions.

Here are a few of the main channels: (you must first [join the Slack workspace](https://aka.ms/vscode-dev-community) before the links below will work)
- [vscode-dev](https://vscode-dev-community.slack.com/messages/C74E1CNGL) for general VS Code discussions.
- [vscode-extensions-dev](https://vscode-dev-community.slack.com/messages/C74CB59NE) for discussions about extension development.
- [vscode-themes](https://vscode-dev-community.slack.com/messages/CBQAQ5GAD/) for discussions about theme authoring.

Just like the Gitter room, the VS Code team's presence in this Slack workspace will be optional, at least for the foreseeable future.

## Twitter
Watch for tweets from the [**@code**](https://twitter.com/code) account on twitter for announcements and updates from members of the development team.
