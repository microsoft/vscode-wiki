As a development team we have to track and want to be present on many channels (github issues, twitter, stack overflow, user voice, gitter). We want to be responsive and at the same time be effective, for example, we want to avoid having to provide the same answer on different channels. This page describes how we manage the different channels.

## [Github issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues)
Issues on github should be used for bugs and feature requests. How to submit good bugs and feature requests is described in [[Submitting Bugs and Suggestions]] and how we track issues is described in [[Issue Tracking]].

Notice we would not like to use Github Issues for general 'how-to' questions about Code and we will sometimes redirect general questions to Stack Overflow. 

## [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode)
Stack Overflow is the best place for getting high quality answers. Many Code community members are already on Stack Overflow and provide great answers to 'how-to' questions. A development team member tracks stack overflow for questions without an answer and jumps in as needed. 

>Therefore please be not upset when we close an issue with the comment to ask a question on Stack Overflow. 

## [Gitter Chat Room](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/vscode)
The Gitter channel provides a place where the Community can get together and collaborate. It is actually great to see that folks have already started to collaborate and support each other there. However, the VS Code team's presence in the room will be very limited, at least for the foreseeable future. We hope the Community will use the room and have discussions.

## [User Voice]()
